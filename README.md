## How To Play
The goal is to keep the monster. The burgers are escaping from the monster and we try to catch burgers and feed the monster with the burgers. We have six fences to keep burgers inside but burgers can brake the fences. We can repair fences using our coins. We can earn coins by feeding the monster.
